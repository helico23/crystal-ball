# Crystal ball project

This is the first personal project I created after an 8-week introduction course on HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
It is a simple one-page website where you submit an open question through a form and receive a random answer out of 8 possibilities in return.
It features some design elements and a small carousel where you can select your favorite crystal ball, hoping to increase your chances of getting a favorable answer.

## How it went

It is my first passion project. I wanted to show my teachers something that incorporated several aspects of their teaching, so I set myself the deadline of submitting it during our last session.
Building the structure went pretty fast (HTML and CSS), but once I got to the JavaScript file, everything took a slower turn. That's when it all really began. While writing the code, new ideas kept coming to me, so I had to write them down in a to-do list. I spent a lot of time trying to implement various things, but in the end, I decided to focus on building something I felt confident about. I can explain every line of this code, and the design looks good to me.

## Limitations

It took me a day and a half to complete this project. I know that's a long time for this result, but it was mostly because I tried to implement additional features.
It is my first passion project, given its small size, I didn't plan it beyond what I had in my head and a small to-do list. I know my next project will need to be more carefully planned than this one.
Even though I created three sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), the appearance on my teacher's desktop computer, which has a very large screen, was not satisfactory to me.

## Future features?

- Make an English version available. [Added 13/07]
- Submit with a click on the crystal ball. [Added 13/07]
- Add multiple transitions for the crystal ball.
- Make the answer appear gradually.

## Final words

I completed this project in mid-April 2025. It has been a month and a half since then. For now, I will publish it as it was written then.
I have learned a lot since then (at least Git!) and I am still progressing. I hope to publish more advanced work soon.
